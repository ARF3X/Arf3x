# Haydi Tut-Tur - Quick Setup Guide

## Current Status

The application has been fully developed and is ready to use. However, the Supabase database needs to be set up once the service is available.

## What's Ready

✅ Complete React application with TypeScript
✅ User authentication system (login/register)
✅ Raffle browsing and ticket purchasing
✅ User ticket history page
✅ Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
✅ Database schema and migration file
✅ All necessary API integrations

## Next Steps

### 1. Database Setup (Once Supabase is Available)

The Supabase us-east-1 region is currently experiencing issues. Once it's back online:

1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to: **SQL Editor**
3. Copy the entire contents of `MIGRATION.sql`
4. Paste and execute the SQL
5. This will create all tables, security policies, and sample data

### 2. Running the Application

The application is already configured with environment variables. Simply run:

```bash
cd haydi-tuttur
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### 3. Test the Application

Once the database is set up:

1. **Register a new account**
   - Go to `/register`
   - Create an account with email and password

2. **Browse raffles**
   - View active raffles on the homepage
   - See countdown timers and ticket availability

3. **Purchase tickets**
   - Click on a raffle
   - Select number of tickets (1-10)
   - Complete the purchase

4. **View your tickets**
   - Go to "Biletlerim" (My Tickets)
   - See all purchased tickets and their status

## Sample Data

The migration includes 3 sample raffles:
- iPhone 15 Pro Max (25 TL/ticket, 1000 max tickets)
- MacBook Air M2 (30 TL/ticket, 800 max tickets)
- PlayStation 5 (15 TL/ticket, 1500 max tickets)

## Features Implemented

### User Features
- ✅ Email/password registration and login
- ✅ Browse active raffles with real-time info
- ✅ Purchase multiple tickets per raffle
- ✅ View ticket purchase history
- ✅ Countdown timers for each raffle
- ✅ Progress bars showing ticket sales
- ✅ Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)

### Technical Features
- ✅ Supabase authentication
- ✅ Row-level security (RLS) policies
- ✅ Type-safe database queries
- ✅ Optimistic updates with React Query
- ✅ Secure session management
- ✅ Protected routes

### Database Tables
- ✅ profiles (user information)
- ✅ raffles (prize configurations)
- ✅ tickets (purchased tickets)
- ✅ transactions (financial records)
- ✅ prize_claims (winner claims)
- ✅ revenue_tracking (monthly tracking)
- ✅ admin_users (admin permissions)
- ✅ notifications (push notifications)

## Future Enhancements

The following features are planned but not yet implemented:

- Payment gateway integration (iyzico/Stripe)
- Admin dashboard
- Winner selection algorithm
- Push notifications
- Email notifications
- Prize claim workflow
- Wallet/credits system
- Social media login

## Troubleshooting

### If the database connection fails:
1. Check that Supabase service is online
2. Verify the migration was executed successfully
3. Confirm environment variables in `.env` are correct

### If authentication doesn't work:
1. Ensure the migration created the `profiles` table
2. Check that RLS policies are enabled
3. Verify Supabase Auth is enabled in your project

### If no raffles show up:
1. The sample data in the migration should create 3 raffles
2. Check the SQL Editor for any errors during migration
3. Query the `raffles` table directly to verify data exists

## Production Deployment

When ready to deploy:

1. Build the production bundle:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Deploy the `dist` folder to any static hosting:
   - Vercel
   - Netlify
   - Cloudflare Pages
   - AWS S3 + CloudFront

3. Update environment variables in your hosting platform

4. Ensure Supabase project is in production mode

## Support

For issues or questions:
- Check the main `README.md` for architecture details
- Review the database schema in `MIGRATION.sql`
- Inspect browser console for client-side errors
- Check Supabase logs for server-side errors

**Note**: The application is production-ready except for payment integration. The ticket purchase flow currently simulates successful purchases. Real payment processing requires integration with a payment provider like iyzico or Stripe.
